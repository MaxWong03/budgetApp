Budget app allows the users to plan their budget for the current month. The app allows users list their expenses and incomes with a description as well as a value. Should the users made a mistake while inputting their expenses or income, the app allows the users to delete the exisiting entries so that they can re-enter their data. The app shows the users whether they have a positive or negative balance for the current month, and calculates the percentage of each expense (and the total expenses) in relation to the income.
